# Hello there!

My name is Sergey, I am experienced web developer.
Today my primary tech stack is Rust, PostgreSQL, TypeScript and React.
Back in the days I used to work also a lot with Ruby and Rails.

I am very passionate about Rust and the development practices that lead to reliable software.

My editor is (Neo)Vim, my operating system is Linux.

I maintain number of open source projects (see the pinned projects below) and write tech articles in my blog [greyblake.com](https://greyblake.com).

As fun fact about me, I speak Esperanto <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Flag_of_Esperanto.svg" width="32" style="display: inline-block"/>.

If you want to contact me, feel free to drop a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/greyblake).
